# WHY: Route different URLs to different services
# PROBLEM: External traffic needs to reach the right internal service
# SOLUTION: Ingress rules map URLs to services

# Traffic Flow:
# Internet → Ingress Controller → Ingress Rules → ClusterIP Service → Pods
#
# Examples:
# http://myapp.local/       → frontend-service
# http://api.local/api/users → api-service  
# http://api.local/health   → api-service (exact match only)
